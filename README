A implementation of breaking Hidden Field Equation(HFE) system using Grobner basis approach.

The code of HFE public key instance construction part is quoted from the thesis"Algebraic cryptanalysis of Hidden Field Equations family" by Adam Janovsky.

We provide the decryption part and our improved Grobner basis attack which speeds up the performance.
The computation is executed over GF(2) and the plaintext is randomly generated.

Usage: ./sage HFE.sage [plaintext length]

You may comment the part of printing the text and remain the statement "print elapsed_time" to use runner.sh to see the running performance.
